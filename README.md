# Audit

A super simple, clean and pretty wrapper around Golang's built-in logger implementation. Requires a UTF-16 capable font and terminal for certain features.
Logs single lines to stdout and optionally a file. Easily configurable right through code, or through a .ENV file (soon!)

## TODO:
- [ ] Implement TRACE
- [ ] Implement ERROR alerts to 3rd party logging systems like Grafana and Datadog
